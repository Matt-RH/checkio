def popular_words(text: str, words: list) -> dict:
    """
    In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words
    in the text. At the input of your function are given 2 arguments: the text
    and the array of words the popularity of which you need to determine.
    When solving this task pay attention to the following points:

    The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need
    to find a word "one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will
    do. The search words are always indicated in the lowercase. If the word
    wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary
    with 0 (zero) value.

    Input: The text and the search words array.
    Output: The dictionary where the search words are the keys and values are
    the number of times when those words are occurring in a given text.

    Precondition: The input text will consists of English letters in uppercase
    and lowercase and whitespaces.
